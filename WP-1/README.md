- perfecttype-img.zip: a compressed disk image of the PerfectType suite for the
  WP-1. This needs to be written to a 240kB 3.5" disk using GCR encoding.

- perfecttype-files.zip: the contents of the above disk image, extracted to
  files for ease of use.

- roms-german.zip: the two 64kB ROMs from a German model WP-1 (branded
  'M-OFFICE').

**Note:** neither of the disk images have been tested. I got them second hand
and they may not even be for a WP1. --davidgiven
